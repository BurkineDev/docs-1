 **Spyware** is malicious computer software that takes a user's personal data and sends it to other companies and apps without the person's consent or knowledge.

## Why is Spyware harmful?

Since Spyware steals a person's information and sends it others, it can put the person in all sorts of situations whether it's receiving bills for unintended purchases, private information being leaked to the public, or prevent you from signing in to the user's Apple or Google Play account to download music and apps. In other words, spyware ruins lives.

## How does Spyware infect devices?

Spyware infects a person's devices in the following ways

- Clicking on a suspicious looking prompt or pop-up window

- Downloading software and other forms of media from an unsecured website
